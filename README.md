The complexity and criticality of modern enterprise databases necessitate advanced approaches for DBAs to become proactive
in the way they manage performance. The volume of raw performance data provided by the database has increased beyond
the point where it is useful without meaningful analysis.

Proactive DBAs rely on specialist technology to continuously monitor and analyze database performance and to provide high quality, decision-ready information that eliminates guesswork from the assessment process. 

Technology is also deployed to automate complex optimization tasks and to help DBAs meet specific performance objectives:

1) Accelerated problem resolution

2) Problem prevention

3) Maximizing hardware resources

4) Reducing risk during change
